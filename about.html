        <h2>1893 - The Beginning:</h2>
        <h3>Eco-friendly Idol</h3>
        Nanasaheb Priviwale of Pune witnessed the Ganpati festival in Valher,
        inspiring him to unite society for freedom. He introduced the concept in
        Pune, initially met with resistance due to the city's conservative
        reputation. Lokamanya Tilak convened a meeting, inviting Dagdusheth
        Halwai, the Nagarsheth of Pune, and Mayavars. They decided to celebrate
        the seven-day Ganpati festival at five city locations, with locals
        funding it. The response was so positive that Lokamanya Tilak urged the
        public to join, leading to a ten-day celebration in 1893. Dagdusheth
        Halwai introduced an environmentally-friendly idol, differing from
        traditional warrior Ganesha forms. This concept aimed to bless and
        protect society. Shri Naik crafted this idol, which became the symbol of
        the Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Trust's Ganesh Utsav.

        <h1>Statue of 1896</h1>
        In 1896, a plague hit Pune. Dagdusheth Halwai's son's absence saddened
        him. After his son's death, Dagdusheth passed away within a few months,
        leaving his wife and wealth. To address this, their spiritual guru, Shri
        Madhavnath Maharaj, advised building the Shri Datta Temple in
        Dagdusheth's name. Dagdusheth's wife, following the guru's guidance,
        decided to construct the Datta Mandir and had a second Lord Ganesha idol
        crafted by sculptor Shri Naik. In 1897, the young people were given this
        idol to start celebrating the Ganpati Utsav. In 1952, businessmen and
        youths, including Tatyasaheb Godse and his colleagues Dattoba Chavan,
        Mamasaheb Rasane, Laxmanrao Jamdade, Gajanan Kedari, Navrtirao Raikar,
        Balkrishna Jamdade, Shankarao Suryavanshi and Kashinathrao Rasane, took
        over the festival until 1967. They collected donations and celebrated
        the Amrit Mahotsav. In 75 years, the idol's arm broke, leading to
        discussions about replacing it. The broken idol was meticulously
        repaired and now resides in Ganesh Mandir and Raman in Kondhwa Child
        Care Center of the Trust.

        <h1>1968 Ladiwal Murti (Idol)</h1>
         In 1968, discussions began about making a new
        Ganesha idol after the Amrit Mahotsav. Dr. Balasaheb Paranjpe suggested
        Nagesh Shalp, who was skilled in clay sculpture. After obtaining a photo
        of the old idol, Shankarappa Salpi, known for his Carnatic-style
        artistry, was tasked with creating a one-meter-tall clay idol. This
        initial idol was presented to traders in Ali for approval. Following
        their endorsement, Shankarappa was commissioned to make a larger
        version. Shankarappa suggested incorporating a Ganesha Yantra in the
        idol's belly, in alignment with traditional practices. He performed
        religious rituals and placed the Yantra on the idol during a solar
        eclipse at the Mula Mutha river confluence in Pune. This Yantra ritual
        was maintained for twelve months. On August 27, 1968, the idol was
        consecrated in a dignified and scientific manner. Since then, it has
        adhered to Hindu customs without deviation. This marked the beginning of
        a new era, as it's uncommon to create clay idols in temples in India. In
        1984, the first Lord Ganesha temple was built near Budhwar Peth.
        Subsequently, in 2005, a grand temple was established in the same
        neighbourhood.
