            <h1 >The Dagadusheth Halwai Ganapati temple </h1>

            <div style="font-size: 20px;">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai and his wife Laxmibai was a trader and sweet maker settled in Pune. His original halwai shop still exists under the name " <u>Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets</u> " near Datta Mandir in Pune. Eventually he became a successful sweet seller and a <b>Rich Businessman</b>. In the later 1800s, they lost their only son in a plague epidemic. They were approached by a compassionate sage who advised them to build a Ganesha temple in Pune.[6]

Later, as they did not have any heir, Dagdusheth adopted his nephew <b>Govindsheth</b> who was 9 years old at the time of their death. Govindsheth was born in 1891 in Pune. He replaced the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at Akra Maruti Chowk. A kind-hearted and generous man, he established one more Ganesh idol in wrestlers training center, which is called Jagoba Dada Talim. This talim was owned by <b>Dagdusheth</b> as he was also a former wrestling trainer. One of the chowk (area) in Pune is named Govind Halwai Chowk, after him. Along with his mother, Govindsheth handled all the programmes like Ganesh Utsav, Datta Jayanti and other festivities. The residence where they resided is now known as Laxmibai Dagdusheth Halwai Sansthan Datta Mandir Trust. Laxmi Road in Pune is named after Laxmibai Dagdusheth halwai. Govindsheth died in 1943. His son Dattatray Govindsheth Halwai, born in 1926, was the one who established the third Ganesh idol replacing the second. This idol, known as <b>Navasacha Ganpati</b>, is the one that is present today in the Dagdusheth temple. It proved to be an epoch-making event in Indian history.
